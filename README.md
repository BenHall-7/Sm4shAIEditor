# Sm4shAIEditor

AI File manager capable of mass disassembly and assembly of ATKD, script, and AIPD filetypes in Sm4sh. 

**Interface**

The program uses a simple GUI that enables one to setup workspace/compilation directories from game data and efficiently disassemble/assemble files from any chosen fighter or filetype. Once disassembled, direct file editing is left in favor of other tools such as Notepad++. This program's features are also available from the command line; to see the option syntax, give it the "h" argument.

**Building**
